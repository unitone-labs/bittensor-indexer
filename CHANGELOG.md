## [0.1.1] - 2025-07-11
### Changed

* **Context**: Now generic (`Context<C: Config>`) and includes a new public field `block_hash` representing the hash of the processed block. This field is available in all handlers and enables unique identification of the current block within the pipeline.
* **ChainEvent**: Introduces a new public field `index`, which indicates the event's position (`event_index`) within the blockâ€™s event list. This allows for unique identification of every event in a block.
* **Propagation**: All references to `Context` and `ChainEvent` in examples, pipelines, and tests were updated to use the new structures and constructors.
